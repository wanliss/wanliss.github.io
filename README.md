I’m James Wanliss, a Professor of General Engineering in the LAUCATED, the **L**aboratory at **A**nderson **U**niversity for **C**omplex and **T**urbulent **E**ngineering **D**ynamics.

My previous roles include Professor of Physics at Presbyterian College, Associate Professor of Engineering Physics at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Visiting Associate Professor at Nagoya Univeristy and Kyung-Hee University.

My current research interests include:

Probabilistic Machine Learning Fundamentals (including generative models and uncertainty-aware approaches)
Space Weather Forecasting (especially for weather, earth systems, and climate prediction)
Spatio-temporal Modelling (especially using a fusion of large-scale deep learning and probabilistic modelling for scientific applications)
